# **1. What is HTML?**

#### Definition

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard language used to create and design webpages. HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of tags and elements.

#### Key Features

- **Markup Language**: HTML uses tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`) to define the structure and content of a webpage.
- **Static Content**: HTML creates static webpages, but it can be combined with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to make dynamic websites.
- **Platform-Independent**: HTML works on all devices and browsers.

#### Example of HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is my first webpage created using HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Explanation

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document as an HTML5 file.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document (e.g., title, character encoding).
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the webpage.

### **2. What is the Internet?**

#### Definition

The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized protocols (e.g., TCP/IP). It allows users to share information, access resources, and communicate across the world.

#### Key Features

- **Network of Networks**: The Internet connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.
- **Protocols**: Communication over the Internet is governed by protocols like **HTTP/HTTPS** (for webpages), **SMTP** (for emails), and **FTP** (for file transfers).
- **Accessibility**: The Internet enables access to websites, online services, and digital content from anywhere in the world.

#### Analogy

Think of the Internet as a highway system. Just as highways connect cities and towns, the Internet connects computers and devices globally.

### **3. What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?**

#### Definition

The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, often simply called "the web," is a system of interlinked hypertext documents and resources accessed via the Internet. It was invented by **Tim Berners-Lee** in 1989.

#### Key Features

- **Hypertext**: Text that contains links to other documents or resources. Clicking on a link takes you to another webpage.
- **URLs**: Each webpage or resource on the web has a unique address called a **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).
- **Browsers**: Users access the web through **web browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

#### Difference Between Internet and WWW

- The **Internet** is the infrastructure (hardware and protocols) that connects devices.
- The **WWW** is a service that runs on top of the Internet, allowing users to access webpages and resources.

#### Analogy

If the Internet is the highway system, the WWW is the cars and trucks traveling on it, carrying passengers (data) to their destinations.

### **4. What is a Website?**

#### Definition

A **website** is a collection of related webpages hosted on a server and accessible via the Internet. Websites are used to provide information, services, or entertainment to users.

#### Key Features

- **Domain Name**: A website is identified by a domain name (e.g., `www.google.com`).
- **Hosting**: Websites are stored on servers provided by hosting companies.
- **Types of Websites**:
  - **Static Websites**: Websites with fixed content (created using only HTML/CSS).
  - **Dynamic Websites**: Websites with interactive and changing content (created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend languages like PHP or Python).

#### Example

- **Google** (`www.google.com`) is a website that provides search services.
- **Wikipedia** (`www.wikipedia.org`) is a website that provides free knowledge.

### **5. What is a Webpage?**

#### Definition

A **webpage** is a single document or page within a website. It is written in HTML and may include additional technologies like CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.

#### Key Features

- **Structure**: A webpage consists of headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements defined by HTML.
- **URL**: Each webpage has its own unique URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com/about`).
- **Content**: Webpages can display text, images, videos, forms, and more.

#### Example

- The homepage of a website (`https://www.example.com`) is one webpage.
- The "About Us" section of the same website (`https://www.example.com/about`) is another webpage.
