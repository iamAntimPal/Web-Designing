# HTML Course Syllabus

## Introduction  

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,IT)) ([Basic HTML syntax - Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax#:~:text=HTML%20%20,the%20following%20line%20of%20text)). This syllabus provides a comprehensive roadmap from basic to advanced HTML topics, including modern HTML5 features and best practices. It is designed to be beginner-friendly, requiring no prior programming experience ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=The%20W3Schools%20HTML%20Tutorial%20is,friendly)). The content is organized into bite-sized, step-by-step lessons so learners can build understanding gradually ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=The%20content%20has%20been%20proven,is%20updated%20and%20improved%20frequently)), and is updated regularly to reflect current standards.

## How to Use This Syllabus  

- **Follow the sequence:** Work through topics in order or jump to sections as needed. The syllabus is modular, so you can focus on specific areas (e.g. forms or multimedia) once you have the basics.  
- **Hands-on practice:** Use a code editor or online playground to write and test HTML as you learn. Try out every example and experiment by modifying the code.  
- **Use examples and exercises:** Each section includes examples. Apply concepts by building small web pages. Look for exercises or quizzes (e.g. on w3schools.com or MDN) to reinforce learning.  
- **For instructors:** Educators can adapt each section into lecture notes or assignments. The outline can guide lesson plans, with recommended reading and practice activities for each topic.

## Target Audience  

- **Beginners:** Individuals new to coding or web design; W3Schools notes the content “is designed for beginners and requires no prior experience” ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=It%20will%20give%20you%20a,fundamental%20knowledge%20of%20HTML)).

## Full HTML Syllabus (Basic to Advanced)

### HTML Fundamentals  

- **Introduction to HTML:** Learn what HTML is and its role in web development ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,IT)) ([Basic HTML syntax - Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax#:~:text=HTML%20%20,the%20following%20line%20of%20text)). Understand the basic structure of an HTML document (doctype, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`) and how browsers interpret HTML.  
- **Core Elements:** Use essential tags such as headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and text formatting (bold, italic). Create hyperlinks with `<a>` tags and embed images with `<img>` tags, using attributes like `href`, `src`, and `alt` ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,colors%2C%20sizes%2C%20links)).  
- **Lists and Groups:** Build ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists with `<li>` items. Understand when to use list elements for organizing content ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,colors%2C%20sizes%2C%20links)).  
- **Tables and Forms (Basics):** Create tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`) for tabular data, including headers, row/column spans, and styling. Introduce simple forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`) and input attributes (text, email, password) ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,structured%20website)).  
- **Attributes & Metadata:** Apply attributes (e.g. `id`, `class`, `style`) to elements to control behavior and appearance. Learn about metadata: `<title>`, `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, and including a favicon, which are crucial for page information and encoding.  
- **Comments & Validation:** Add HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) for documentation. Use HTML validators (like the W3C Validator) to check code for errors and ensure standards compliance.

### HTML Structure & Semantics  

- **Semantic Elements:** Utilize HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to give meaning to page structure ([HTML5 Semantics | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html5-semantics/#:~:text=HTML5%20introduced%20a%20range%20of,elements%20clearly%20define%20their%20content)). These tags improve accessibility and SEO by clearly defining content sections ([HTML5 Semantics | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html5-semantics/#:~:text=Why%20Use%20Semantic%20HTML%20Tags%3F)).  
- **Container Elements:** Understand the difference between block-level (e.g. `<div>`) and inline (e.g. `<span>`) elements, and use them to group content for styling and layout. Learn when to use a `<div>` or `<span>` versus a semantic element.  
- **Responsive Basics:** Introduce responsive design with the viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport">`) and responsive images (`<picture>`, `srcset`). Understand mobile-friendly layouts (mobile-first design).  
- **Accessibility & SEO:** Write accessible HTML by using `alt` text for images, `<label>` for form controls, and ARIA attributes for assistive technologies. Follow best practices for semantic markup to make content understandable by screen readers and search engines ([HTML5 Semantics | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html5-semantics/#:~:text=Why%20Use%20Semantic%20HTML%20Tags%3F)).

### HTML Forms & User Input  

- **Form Structure:** Build complete forms with the `<form>` element. Include various form controls: text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns (`<select>`), and buttons ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,structured%20website)).  
- **Form Attributes:** Set form attributes such as `action` (where to send data) and `method` (GET or POST). Use input attributes (e.g. `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`) for basic client-side validation without scripts.  
- **Advanced Input Types:** Explore HTML5 input types (email, url, date, range, color, etc.) and how they improve user experience and validation. Learn about file upload inputs (`<input type="file">`) and using `<textarea>` for multi-line input.  
- **Form Accessibility:** Ensure forms are accessible: associate `<label>` elements with inputs, use `aria-*` attributes if needed, and provide clear instructions. Understand form best practices for all users.

### HTML Multimedia & Graphics  

- **Images:** Embed raster images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) with `<img>`, and learn about attributes like `width`, `height`, and `alt` ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=,colors%2C%20sizes%2C%20links)). Explore vector graphics via SVG (`<svg>`). Use responsive techniques (e.g. `srcset`) for different screen sizes.  
- **Audio & Video:** Embed audio with `<audio>` and video with `<video>` tags, including attributes like `controls`, `autoplay`, and `<source>` elements for multiple formats. Understand browser support and fallback content.  
- **Canvas & SVG:** Use the `<canvas>` element with the Canvas API (JavaScript) to draw shapes and animations. Learn basics of working with SVG for scalable, resolution-independent graphics.  
- **Embedding Content:** Use `<iframe>` to embed external content (e.g. YouTube videos, maps) and understand security considerations (sandboxing). Add plugins or object/embed tags if needed for legacy content.

### HTML APIs & Advanced Features  

- **Web APIs:** Interface with HTML-supported Web APIs such as Geolocation (`navigator.geolocation`), Drag-and-Drop (`draggable`, `ondrop`), Web Storage (`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`), Web Workers, and Server-Sent Events ([HTML Syllabus (Curriculum)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_syllabus.asp#:~:text=HTML%20APIs)). These APIs are accessed via HTML/JavaScript to extend page functionality.  
- **HTML5 Extras:** Learn new HTML5 elements like `<details>`, `<summary>`, and `<dialog>` for interactive UI. Understand the application cache and service workers for offline web apps, and how to create a web app manifest for Progressive Web Apps.  
- **Data Attributes:** Use custom `data-*` attributes to embed application data in HTML elements for use by scripts.  
- **Web Components (Intro):** Get an overview of Web Components: `<template>` for reusable markup, `<slot>` for shadow DOM content insertion, and Shadow DOM basics for encapsulated styling (note: often paired with JS).  
- **Best Practices:** Understand semantic, valid HTML. Follow coding standards and style guides. Learn SEO essentials (proper heading hierarchy, meta descriptions). Emphasize security (e.g. avoiding inline scripts, sanitizing input) and performance (minimizing tags, deferring scripts).
